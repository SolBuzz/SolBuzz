- ‚ùå Tokens with >50% supply in top 10 wallets
- ‚ùå Projects promising unrealistic returns
- ‚ùå Missing or suspicious liquidity locks
- ‚ùå No audit or code verification

const rpcEndpoints = [
  'https://mainnet-beta.solana.com',
  'https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com',
  'https://solana-api.projectserum.com',
  'https://rpc.ankr.com/solana'
];
```

#### 2. Browser Optimization
- Close unnecessary tabs and extensions
- Use Chrome/Chromium for best performance
- Ensure stable internet connection
- Consider using a VPN with low latency

#### 3. Wallet Configuration
- Use Phantom or Solflare for fastest transaction signing
- Pre-approve transaction limits to reduce confirmation time
- Keep sufficient SOL balance for gas fees
